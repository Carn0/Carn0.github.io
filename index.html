<h2>All About HTML Programming</h2>
<h3>Some Rules:</h3>
1. Code Words must be as tags<br>
2. Tags are usually in pairs<br>
3. The Tags are nested; Do Not Cross Lines<br>
4. Always document your program.
<!-- This is a Comment Tag  -->

<h4>Other HTML Formatting Rules</h4>
1. Use the p-tag to setup paragraphs.
<p>
Ontario Deputy Premier and Minister of Health, <b><i>Christine Elliott</i></b>, maintained Tuesday that she doesn't believe it's "necessary" for Premier Doug Ford to apologize for comments he made about immigrants a day earlier.</p>
<!-- Changing the background colour  -->
<p style="background-color:red;">2. Use the i-tag for italics<br>
and use the b-tag as above paragraph for bold text<br>
<i>
"What the premier was actually saying is that we need more immigrants in Ontario,"</i> Elliott said at a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
<p>3. Certain tags can have attributes which in turn have elements. So in the next paragraph, we        will change the font color.
    </p>

<!-- You can add attributes to a tag  -->
<p style="color:blue;">While making an announcement in Windsor-Essex, Ford spoke about the shortage of workers in the province and said "new Canadians" have to "work [their] tail off" in Ontario.</p>
